# English-to-Hinglish-Translation
This model is designed to translate English text to Hinglish using the Google Translate API and a transliteration mapping .

transliteration_map:  This mapping is used to replace specific Hindi words with their Hinglish counterparts during the translation.
Remember to customize the transliteration_map with additional mappings if needed to handle more words and phrases in your translations.

To use this code to translate English text to Hinglish, you need to provide the input text as follows:

Run the Python script.

When prompted, enter the English text you want to translate.

The script will then use the Google Translate API and the transliteration_map to translate the text and provide the Hinglish output.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the code:

 -Download the code file from repository 
 
 -import the file to google collab to run it
 
 -or else you can directly copy and paste the code to run in google collab.

When prompted, enter the English text you want to translate, for example:

So even if it's a big video, I will clearly mention all the products.

The script will translate the input text to Hinglish and display the result:

Result: तो भले ही यह एक बड़ा vedio है, मैं स्पष्ट रूप से सभी product का उल्लेख करूंगा।.
